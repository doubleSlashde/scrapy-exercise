# Web scraping excercise with Scrapy

This is a Scrapy project to scrape quotes from famous people from http://quotes.toscrape.com.
This example was adopted from ([here](https://github.com/scrapinghub/spidyquotes)). 
This project is only meant for educational purposes.

## Prequisites

First, a working Python3 installation is required for running Scrapy.
Please use the Miniconda Python 3.7 installation for your OS, it can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
After Miniconda has been installed successfully, go to the start menu and open 'Anaconda Promt' as administrator.

Prior to running any Scrapy spider, Scrapy has to be installed with the following command:
    
    $ conda install -c conda-forge scrapyÂ 

Or if you already have a working Python installation with pip as package manager:

    $ pip install scrapy

## Running the spiders

You can run a spider using the `scrapy crawl` command, such as:

    $ scrapy crawl quotes_spider

If you want to save the scraped data to a file, you can pass the `-o` option:
    
    $ scrapy crawl quotes_spider -o quotes.json
